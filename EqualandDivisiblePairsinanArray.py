# Input: nums = [3,1,2,2,2,1,3], k = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# There are 4 pairs that meet all the requirements:
# - nums[0] == nums[6], and 0 * 6 == 0, which is divisible by 2.
# - nums[2] == nums[3], and 2 * 3 == 6, which is divisible by 2.
# - nums[2] == nums[4], and 2 * 4 == 8, which is divisible by 2.
# - nums[3] == nums[4], and 3 * 4 == 12, which is divisible by 2.
